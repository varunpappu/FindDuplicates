# Find Duplicates

There is a file with 6 million registration (format AAA999). The contest is to write a program that 
determines whether there are any duplicate registration or not. The program need not say which or how many. 
The program will be a console application (executable file) or similar which takes a file argument. 
The program will print: "Not Duplicate" and "Duplicate".
